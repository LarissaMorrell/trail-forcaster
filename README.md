#Trail Forecaster
Thinkful (https://www.thinkful.com) end of course portfolio project for front-end web development.

##Introduction
Trail Forecaster allows you to easily find hiking trails in your area. With one click, you are able to see a description of the trail you are interested in, directions, the current weather, the past 3 days weather, and the weather forecast for the next 3 days. Finally, there is an app that allows users to determine if a trail will be muddy, dusty, be full of puddles, or have freshly fallen snow. A more knowledgable hiker is a better prepared hiker and a safer hiker.

##Use Case
Why is this app useful? The more a hiker knows about a trail, the safer he or she will be. Preparing for hike on a sunny, 70 degree day is a lot different than preparing for a hike when its 40 degrees and raining. By knowing if it has rained or snowed recently, you will be able to pack appropriate waterproofing gear. Not leaving today? That's why the weather for the next 3 days is also included.

##Technical
This app was built HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and JavaScript.
This app accesses 3 APIs:
	*TrailAPI (https://market.mashape.com/trailapi/trailapi) for all trail information
	*APIXU History Weather API (https://www.apixu.com)
